Notes:
1. App has been built from the beginning to familiarize myself with Graphql.
2. For DI Hilt was used instead of Dagger as I'm more experienced with hilt and it is easier to use.
3. Layers were not split into separate modules in order to not waste time dealing with dependencies, but this is something I'll do before interview
4. Github personal token is read from local.properties
